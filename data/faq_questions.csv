How often will my child be reviewed at Kings?,Every child will be seen 4-6 weeks after their admission following Kasai. Follow up will then be decided based on clinical need and if your child’s liver condition is stable typical follow up is two times a year. 
Is it possible for our appointments be closer to where we live?,"As there are only three children’s liver disease services in the UK (London, Birmingham and Leeds) we prefer for our patients to continue to be follow up by a specialist service.
However, we do run some outreach clinics around the country, so you are very welcome to discuss this with the team.
"
Do you provide any accommodation for our families close to the hospital?,We do understand that some families have to travel far; we have accommodation with the Ronald Macdonald house near to the hospital. Please contact the liver CNS team who can forward your email to our family liaison officer if you need additional accommodation when you have to come to the hospital.
Stools look pale what should I do?,"Following the Kasai surgery, it may take some time for the stools to become pigmented. 
If your child’s stools have been pigmented after the surgery and they turn suddenly pale on one occasion with no signs of jaundice of fever, you can observe the stools within the next 24 hours. If they remain pale, we advise to contact the CNS team for advice. 
If your child’s stools become pale and your child is unwell with a fever or jaundice, this could be a sign of an infection in the bile ducts, called cholangitis and you will need to take your child to your local hospital for review. Treatment with antibiotics might be required.

If your child develops fever and appears well, give one dose of paracetamol and recheck temperature a couple of hours later, if a second fever occurs seek medical review

We can ask your GP to refer to an ear, nose and throat specialist."

Will my child have problems with digesting certain foods when they get older?,"At the time of surgery, the gallbladder is removed as it was not functioning well, so it is possible that your child might have more difficulties with absorbing fat from their food intake and therefore open their bowels more regularly in particular after having fatty food.
They will need to continue vitamin supplements for this reason. 
"
"
How long does my child need to have weekly weights?
